## Upcoming Release
* `New-AzResourceGroupDeployment` and `New-AzManagementGroupDeployment` now report resource progress with `-Verbose`, like Az PowerShell.
    - While the deployment runs, they write `Checking deployment status in 5 seconds` and `Resource <type> '<name>' provisioning status is <state>` for each new resource state.
    - Progress is best effort: if the deployment's operations can't be read, one verbose note is written and the deployment's result is unchanged.

## Version 0.1.4
* Added management-group deployment create, get, stop, remove, and test cmdlets.
    - `New-AzManagementGroupDeployment` and `Test-AzManagementGroupDeployment` take the same template and parameter inputs as the resource group deployment cmdlets (`-TemplateFile`, `-TemplateUri`, `-TemplateSpecId`, `-ParametersFile`, `-ParametersUri`, `-Parameter`, `-Mode`, `-ValidationLevel`).
    - `New-AzManagementGroupDeployment` validates using `Incremental` mode before deploying with the selected `-Mode` and outputs `DeploymentExtended`.
    - `Test-AzManagementGroupDeployment` always validates using `Incremental` mode, outputs `DeploymentValidateResult`, and throws on validation errors.
    - `Get-AzManagementGroupDeployment`, `Stop-AzManagementGroupDeployment`, and `Remove-AzManagementGroupDeployment` accept `-Id`.
    - `Remove-AzManagementGroupDeployment` sends delete directly; removing a nonexistent deployment succeeds without output unless `-PassThru` is supplied.
    - `Stop-AzManagementGroupDeployment -PassThru` outputs `true` only when the cancellation runs, not under `-WhatIf` or a declined confirmation.

## Version 0.1.0

* First preview
